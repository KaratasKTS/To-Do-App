Let me make things clear, if you are an unlucky person that maybe steps on this gem through odin, this program has bad code in it and i am fully aware of it, its hardly readable, it follows 0 oop best practices, plus it could be a lot better in terms of functionality - less bugs etc. Reason for this, it took way to long for my timeline and i started rushing (i have a habbit of setting impossible timelines for my self). Dont be like me, be smarter :P
